Staff super friendly and even though we couldn't check in early, we trusted them to put our bags in our room for us ready for when we'd returned later from our event. Staff at breakfast were friendly too. Cold drinks fridge in reception selling large bottles of water and various soft drinks  is a big win too! \nThe surroundings were very quiet and peaceful and the location is FANTASTIC if you're planning a night/weekend in London with 3 tube stations within walking distance including access to the central line which runs 24 hrs!The only thing and I believe this has been mentioned before is the whole building in general seemed very warm. I only say this as a negative as in the summer months it's hard to regulate even though the window was opened. \nPlus there WAS a fan to use already in the room. \nI also am taking note of it being a big positive for in the winter.

Maybe a little pricey but I suspect this is London and hotels are expensive... Probably recently renovated, room in order with all appliances in working order. Some nice touches, such as multiple bedside outlets with USB outlets too. Wifi pretty good.A few details, which are really hard to reconcile with the overall good impression that a customer receives. Specifically, one that makes your eye sore is the elevator keyboard. Hard to describe in word, the keys are all broken and some are kept together with glue which sticks out of the key encasement, others have badly taped paper labels on them... unbelievable. Especially because the elevator looks rather new and modern. It does not make any sense that they don't have it immediately fixed, but the state of the whole keyboard is so degraded that this must have been going on for months. Since every single guest sees it and has to deal with it, if I were a manager I would fix it the next day. Instead... Manager: what are you waiting for? Luckily the room was in order and everything worked fine and looked rather new.",

Yet, this place still managed to disappoint.\rI was given a tiny single room in the basement. If you've ever been in a chemical toilet, then you have an idea of what the bathroom looked like. Completely misleading from the pictures on Booking.com. I should have complained, but honestly I couldn't be bothered given I stayed only a night.\rIn the morning, the basement is where everyone comes for breakfast, so there was a lot of noise even though I requested a quiet room. Speaking about breakfast, paying \u00a33 extra towards the rate sounded like a good deal at the time. It somehow wasn't. Breakfast consisted literally of bread, cut up cheese and ham and some random pastry. There are no warm buffet items. Apparently even a boiled egg is too much effort.\rOverall, a poor claustrophobic experience and I wouldn't recommend.",

Dus is er eigenlijk wel een zichtbaar verschil?\nVoor het ontbijt hoef je het zeker niet te doen. Is in kleine ruimte in de kelder. Hier kan je brood toasten en beleggen met kaas en worst. Yoghurt met cornflakes of een ei is ook een optie. Daarnaast nog kleine afbak croissants of koffiebroodjes. Als je geen strakke planning hebt, zou ik er voor kiezen om voor een beter en gezelliger ontbijt elders te gaan.\nDaarnaast ging het brandalarm af toen we een f\u00f6hn hadden gebruikt in de kamer.

I was then given a room around 6m2 (was not expecting a single room to be this small!) with an external bathroom I asked him where the bathroom and I got ' i don't know' as a response.  He then came back 10mins later with directions and a key. On my last evening, I returned as was told I was meant to have checked out that day they still had no record of the extra evening I had now told them about three times! I really am truly shocked at how my booking was never amended after speaking to three separate people and emailing them 4 times. I am not sure if laziness or a lack of communication.

Particularly when sleeping in the 2nd bed as both the pipes and the radiator were almost touching you.\rThe opening into the ceiling had not been blocked off properly and looked very dirty, also the basin in the bathroom had not been blocked off either and there was a really dirty pink cloth that was encrusted in dust - obviously there to stop leaks.  It looked like it had been there months, not what you would expect to find in such a hotel. Paintwork was in dire need of a repaint around the shower.\rWe were on a Hen Do so we had had a lot to drink so didn't notice these issues until the morning, by which time it was too late.

Creo que es lo mejor que tiene este hotel.Cerca de metro, autobuses que me llevaron donde necesitaba, a solo 5kms de Buckingam Palace, perfecto para ir andando desde alli, traversando un parque enorme. A 1km del Market vintage que habia y a 2.5 Kms del centro comercial mas grande de Londres.\rEl habitacion es peque\u00f1o, pero al final cumpli\u00f3 con mis espectativas de solo dormir por la noche y ya. El ba\u00f1o es muy peque\u00f1o, casi tienes que dejar la puerta abierta para poder hacer las cosas que necesitas.\rEl habitacion esta ubicado abajo, al lado del comedor y de habitacion de las se\u00f1oras de la limpieza. Al principio pens\u00e9 que iba haber mucho ruido por las ma\u00f1anas, pero no fue asi, las se\u00f1oras que trabajaban en el comedor han sido muy silenciosas, casi no habia ruido. Tampoco desde la calle se escuchaba mucho.\rTiene una tele muy grande para el tama\u00f1o del habitacion, con bastante programas, no lo he usado mucho. Tambien wifi con calidad 7.5-8.0/10, a veces se pierde la cobertura, pero dentro de 1min vuelve.\rTambien tiene cafetera, secadora de pelo, un ventilador, telefono fijo- no he usado ninguno de estos para dar mas detalles.El desayuno es basico, se puede mejorar un poquito, hay solo dos tipos de queso, que se termina rapido y dos tipos de jamon cocido. Luego t\u00e9, cafe, leche, cereales, zumo de naranjas y manzanas, pero no es natural. Y poco mas cosas. A mi no me gust\u00f3 tanto, pero tampoco es muy malo. Un 6.0/10 lo valoraria.\rEl personal de la recepcion puede intentar sonreir un poquito mas, me parecieron bastante frios, no te hablan si no hablas tu con ellos, no te preguntan proactivamente que tal estas, si te falta algo,etc.",

In the photos below the first is the images of what I thought I had booked and the second is what I got. I regularly book via Booking.com so know what I\u2019m doing, and when I booked I booked a room as in image 1. However I was given a basement room that you seriously could not swing a cat in, the entire room is in that second photo. And here is the killer \u2026\u2026.\nThey CHARGED ME \u00a3181 for that. Its outrageous. \nWith regards to cost the gentleman who checked me in incredibly said \u201coh you had better see the room first given what you are paying\u201d, but as there was no other rooms free what alternative did I have other than to wander round London at last min with 30kg hoping to find a bed so I was stuck. So he even knew I was paying an outrageous cost for the room. \nThe room was down steep flight of stairs, so I had to drag my heavy case up and down, it was next to the breakfast room so was woken early by breakfast traffic. \nThe room window was a view of a wall and fire stairs up from the basement. Oh and goodness knows what the noises were that I hears outside during the night. \nFinally on complaining I was told I had made a mistake on Booking.com and told \u201csorry sir have a nice day\u201d. \nA very bad experience, be careful.",

The bed was comfortable, the television was of a good size, and the Wifi strength was excellent. Above all, the staff were extremely friendly and very helpful, happily lugging my largest case up to the first landing, which was not served by the elevator and repairing the television, which initially failed to work.The furniture in the room was not of good quality and some of it was broken. The carpet was clean but badly stained and the window would only open a crack, which would have been a serious problem in hotter weather. The continental breakfast was adequate but not distinguished and the use of stools for seating at the long central table (rather than the few tables around the sides, which had comfortable chairs) was unfortunate.",

I don't mind a buffet arrangement but it was a bit basic. We skipped breakfast the next day and went somewhere else nearby. \rI booked for two nights but had to change rooms. At first this seemed an upgrade as I was in a bigger room but on night one the extract fan in the room next door was on and off through the night and even with earplugs was too loud and kept me awake. The next refit should install silent fans. \rThe second night my new room was perfectly quiet so the extract fan issue must only be in specific rooms.

Zum Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck gab es jeden Tag das Gleiche: Eine einzige Sorte Wurst, zwei Sorten trockener K\u00e4se, Toast und Marmelade aus diesen billigen Miniassietten, eigentlich hatten wir uns in London auf ein gutes englischess Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck gefreut...Der Gipfel war allerdings das wir unsere am Morgen bei der Rezeption abgebenen frankierten Postkarten durch einen Zufall nachmittags im M\u00fclleimer der Rezeption vorfanden.

The room was very clean, bed was comfortable, the pillows not so much. we had one extra fold out bed in our room, for what purposes we have no idea but that didn't bother us. Toilet was also very clean. The Staff was very polite and helpful. Very big plus was that there were USB charging spots in the room so when traveling from other country you don't have to buy an extra adaptor for charging your devices. All the sightseeing are very close to the hotel, just a small walk through the Kensington and Hyde park.Out room was exactly next to the elevator so at night you could hear everybody who are coming up or going down with the elevator. You could also hear people talking when waiting their elevator. It was super hot days in London when we stayed. The room was extremely stuffy. Even opening the window didn't help. On our last night we didn't slept much because there was no air in the room, despite that the window was open. We had a van in the room, but it was making too much sound in the night that we could not use it. In the bathroom sink there was no pressure with the water, shower water pressure was good dough. Wifi connection was poor in the 5th floor where we stayed.\rJust a reminder. If you are traveling from Stansted airport and want to leave at night or a super early flight, don't count on the Bolt taxi or Uber because the taxi drivers don't like to drive so far at night and most likely are going to cancel on your request. Leave with airport bus or train. We just got super lucky that the Bolt driver was also traveling from that airport and picked us up in 2:30 am, otherwise we would have missed our flight.",
